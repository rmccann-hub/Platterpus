"""The committed rig scripts are checked by the real language, not by eye.

**Why this file exists.** `docs/rig-scripts/*.txt` are the tests this project
actually runs on hardware — `CLAUDE.md`'s *a new testing capability is a SCRIPT
VERB* means the script language is where the acceptance suite is written. They
are committed artifacts, they cross machines by hand, and until now **nothing
parsed them**. So a step naming a setting that does not exist looked identical to
one that works, right up until an unattended two-hour run recorded an ERROR for
it — and then the run's own summary line reported `error=3` without saying which
three, so the defect survived being measured.

Found the way it always is: `docs/rig-scripts/fullacceptance.txt` carried

    set paranoia_passes 3
    expect paranoia_passes 3

and `paranoia_passes` has never been a field of :class:`~platterpus.config.Config`
in this repository's history. Both steps errored on every run of that script.
They are two of the three errors in the 2026-08-23 full acceptance pass.

**A comment where a check belongs is not a fix** (`CLAUDE.md`), so the fix is this
sweep rather than the corrected line. The population is DERIVED from the
directory, not listed here: a typed list is the hand-maintained field that rots,
inside a test written about an artifact that rotted.
